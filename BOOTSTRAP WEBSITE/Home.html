<p class="font-monospace">Multiple startups ideas have been successful with nature conservation and there’s never been enough. There will always be never-ending need for the conservation of natural resources. Organizations such as blueoak resources have successfully been able to recycle e-waste into a sustainable sources of materials and rare earths for technologies of tomorrow. Based in San Jose, California, Biocollection is a young and small technology company focused on developing new paths to recycling the “unrecyclable plastics.” That is all the plastics that can’t be easily washed and reconstructed at typical recycling plants. The population of India produces about 3.3 million metric tonnes of recyclable waste per year. Agrostar is another startup dedicated to helping farmers by providing real-time advice from experts on how to manage their crops and boost their yield. Conservation of Nature is the responsibility of us to be a responsible citizens. So our project focuses on some innovative ways to save Mother Nature like many of us must have seen Tetra packs for the packaging of various food items such as package long-life milk, juice, and various other liquids. Growing plants is just not enough in today’s scenario so we need to switch to some packaging that is renewable or recycled packing and ensure standards of food safety and can save our Earth. We need to realize that tetra cartons which we just throw away instead of recycling, are a criminal waste of a useful resource. It can be used to convert into many useful things like furniture, desktop items, seats of auto-rickshaws, and many other interesting things. So our website will just try to connect the supplier and collector to provide innovation in an existing system.

Why not save and upgrade our existing plant system so we have just come up with an idea of making a Website for our users so that people can use our project to bring a change in their lives.</p>
